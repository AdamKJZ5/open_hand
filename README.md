Care Platform

A production-ready, full-stack care services platform designed to support families, caretakers, and administrators through a modern, secure, and scalable web application.

This project is being built with a curriculum-first mindset: every feature maps to real-world engineering skills, backend architecture patterns, and production practices. The end goal is a deployable platform that demonstrates full-stack ownership, clean system design, and readiness for real users.

✨ Vision

The Care Platform provides:
	•	A public-facing website for care services and facilities
	•	Private portals for families, caretakers, and administrators
	•	Secure messaging and coordination tools
	•	Career listings and application workflows
	•	A foundation for future AI-assisted features (intake summaries, FAQs, automation)

This is not a demo app—it is structured and built like a real product.
